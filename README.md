# Vim Nearest Complete Improved

This plugin is a fork of [sirdavidoff/vim-nearest-complete](https://github.com/sirdavidoff/vim-nearest-complete).

Simple completion plugin based on open buffers. Completion candidates are sorted by position compared to the cursor. It supports camel cases and snake cases. For instance,
`land` will match `England`, `land_of_joy`, `joy_of_land`, `landOfJoy`, `joyOfLand`.
